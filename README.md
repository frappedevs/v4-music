# v4-music

## What is this?
This repository contains the in-game music playlists for V4, all organized in JSON format.

When a new server launches, it automatically fetches these playlists and converts them into Luau dictionaries, which are used by the game's music system.

## Can I contribute?
Absolutely! We don't always have time to keep the playlists up to date with current music trends. If there's a track you love and think would be a great fit for V4, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Naming Conventions
Playlists are grouped by genre and identified by numbers:
- **One** – Dance/EDM  
- **Two** – Punk, rock, hip-hop, and similar styles  
- **Three** – Lo-fi  
- **Four** – A nostalgic collection from the early days of V4

If a music you want to add does not fit in those categories, write us an issue and we'll see what to do!
